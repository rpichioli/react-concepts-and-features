#spa-with-react-redux

>In development phase

Welcome, this is a SPA (single-page application) built with React + Redux.

The objective is to examplify how to mantain a stateful application manipulating data through Redux applying action and reducer concepts.

Another point is the sync between Redux store (state mantained from any reducers) and the browser LocalStorage the way you can refresh any page and the data will not be lost.

The objective is not to persist database, is to illustrate React-Redux interation. If you want to learn Redux-Database interation, I suggest you to see the repository [react-withnodejs-and-sequelize](https://github.com/rpichioli/react-with-nodejs-and-sequelize) after that - I used axios to request NodeJS API within actions.

### Requirements
You must have **npm** in your OS by installing **NodeJS**, easily found at the official website.

The **npm** is used to install the project dependencies and run it by command line.

### Running the React application
First of all you must open your terminal and go to the ```/src/``` where you can see a **package.json**.

Now you need to install the npm dependencies using the command ```npm install```.

Finally you just must enter ```npm start``` to run the React application.

That's all!
