# spa-with-react-redux

You can see here some React + Redux techniques like dispatching actions, reducer handling state itself and store receiving combined reducers.
We will not persist data to database, we will illustrate on the other hand the synchronization between Redux store and browser LocalStorage.
With store and localStorage working togheter you can refresh data and anything will be lost.
The reducer comes with a default mocked data mass.
To access all of this stuff click on Users Management in menu.


Welcome, this is a React + Redux SPA (single-page application) project.

You can see here some React + Redux techniques like dispatching actions, reducer handling state itself and store receiving combined reducers.

We will not persist data to database, we will illustrate on the other hand the synchronization between Redux store and browser LocalStorage. With store and localStorage working togheter you can refresh data and anything will be lost.

### Suggestion
If you want to learn Redux-Database interation, I suggest you to see my the repository [react-with-nodejs-and-sequelize](https://github.com/rpichioli/react-with-nodejs-and-sequelize) after that - I used axios to request NodeJS API within actions and dispatched it to reducer.

### Requirements
You must have **npm** in your OS by installing **NodeJS**, easily found at the official website.

The **npm** is used to install the project dependencies and run it by command line.

### Running the React application
First of all you must open your terminal and go to the ```/src/``` where you can see a **package.json**.

Now you need to install the npm dependencies using the command ```npm install```.

Finally you just must enter ```npm start``` to run the React application.

That's all!
